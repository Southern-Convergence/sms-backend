# UAC-ACM Authorization Service API

> Standard Vanilla Express Server with a twist!

It is an opinionated way of creating backend services, featuring automatically namespaced routers, dependency injection, fully typed interfaces and more.

It takes a lot of inspiration from Vue.JS's SFC (Single File Components).

*It is unusual for a construction company to have it's own infrastracture for timber, but apparently that's what I'm doing here.*

This isn't merely a product of exploratory development though. Well it is.

If you have any suggestions please open a PR as I am open to discussions.


### For Developers:

```
> Design Paradigms:
* Convention over Configuration
* Do not Repeat Yourself

> Coding Conventions:
* 2-spaced indents
* Snake-Case for internal functions, variables
* Kebab-Case for API Endpoint Names
* Pascal Case for Classes and Enums

Quality Assurance Methods:
* Peer-Review
* Approval-Based
```

I would consider the deferred adoption of micro-services into our suite of applications as <u>technical debt</u> to meet deadlines.
